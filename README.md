1)  Develop a Custom Large Language Model (LLM) for Hospital 
Comparison 
* Build an LLM trained on hospital pricing, doctor details, and healthcare-related data. 
* The LLM will process user queries and provide insights on hospital costs, doctor reviews, 
and treatment options. 
* This LLM will be integrated into the web platform, allowing users to interact with it 
seamlessly.

2) Integrate Doctor Details and Reviews for Informed Decision-Making 
* The LLM will fetch and analyze doctor credentials, experience, and patient reviews from 
platforms like Practo via its api. 
* Sentiment analysis will be applied to patient reviews, helping users assess overall 
satisfaction and trends.

3) Create a Dynamic Dataset with Real-Time Updates 
* Implement web scraping to collect hospital pricing data from official government and 
private hospital websites. 
* Dynamically update the dataset at regular intervals to ensure accuracy and reliability. 
* Store timestamps for each data entry to maintain transparency and trustworthiness. 
4)  Ensure Accessibility and Transparency 
* Provide dual-language support (Hindi and English) for better accessibility, especially for 
rural users. 
* Clearly display data sources of websites from which we have webscrapped our data 
similar to what chat gpt do which ensure our llm is not solely responsible for the data and 
ensure users can verify information independently by visiting that particular website.
